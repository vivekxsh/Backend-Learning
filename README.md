## 📂 Projects & Code Snippets

### 1. 🚀 RESTful API with Node.js & Express
- Implemented basic CRUD operations.
- Integrated with MongoDB using Mongoose.
- Added input validation and error handling.


---

### 2. 🧰 Authentication System
- Built secure login/register system using JWT.
- Password hashing with bcrypt.
- Protected routes with middleware.

---

### 3. 📦 A Joke prefiewer
- Built with Express.js and Node.js.


---

### 4. ⚙️ Middleware Practice
- Custom logging and error middleware.
- Role-based access control example.

## 📘 What I've Learned

- Setting up a Node.js server and routing.
- Connecting to both SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Authentication & authorization flows.
- Writing modular and maintainable code.
- Using tools like Postman, Insomnia, Docker, Git, etc.
- Writing and running tests for backend services.
